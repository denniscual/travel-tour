# Grid System 

This starter kit includes a responsive and mobile first gluid grid system

### How to use

-  This grid system is created using the **Flexbox** property.
- Rows must be placed in a **container**. Container has two types: fluid and fixed. You should specify what type of container you used.
- Content should be placed in column, and each column should be placed in a row.
-  The default value of **container-fluid** is 80% and the **container-fixed** is 960px (max-width). You can override the default value of the container. Just add your custom class. **Hint:** Used *fixed* and *fluid* mixins for adding the value on your custom class.
- When the device screen goes below 550px, the columns are wrapped down. The flexbox direction is column.
- **Columns** should be placed inside the row.
- The columns are following:
	- row__col-1
	- row__col-2
	- row__col-3
	- row__col-4
	- row__col-5
	- row__col-6
	- row__col-7
	- row__col-8
	- row__col-9
	- row__col-10
	- row__col-11
	- row__col12
- Each column will scale the width automatically when the container change. It is using fluid for width.
